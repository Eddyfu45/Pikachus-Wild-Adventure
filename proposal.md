# Proposal of Game

# Pikachu's Wild Adventure

## Game Concept

The game will be made using canvas with a rectangular or squar layout. Enemies will spawn from the top side and move down over time. The enemies will first start off simply heading straight down. Once they reach the bottom, the enemy should cease to exist. Meanwhile, the player can control a "Pikachu" where the goal is to just dodge all the enemies successfully. The hero will start with 6 lives and the game ends when lives <= 0. Levels are progressed over time as the player dodges the enemies, so the goal is to simply avoid the enemies for as long as possible or until you go through all the levels.

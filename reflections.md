1. RESPONSE
I made a general outline of my game with a summary of how it plays, potential changes to game depending on some technical issues, and a picture/diagram as a visual.
2. RESPONSE
My goals for today is to code out the layout and some of its functions.
3. RESPONSE
My main blocker would be whether or not I can google well enough to implement the harder ideas. The general basic structure consists mainly of code we learned in class so that should be fine.

# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?

1. RESPONSE
I made a general outline of my game with a summary of how it plays, potential changes to game depending on some technical issues, and a picture/diagram as a visual.
2. RESPONSE
My goals for today is to code out the layout and some of its functions.
3. RESPONSE
My main blocker would be whether or not I can google well enough to implement the harder ideas. The general basic structure consists mainly of code we learned in class so that should be fine.

I made the start screen.

1. RESPONSE
I did a simple transition between the start screen and the game. Afterwards, I started fiddling around with the AI settings and player character.
2. RESPONSE
My goal today is to at least finish the AI and hopefully start working on how to go between the different levels in the game.
3. RESPONSE
I will have to transition my npc and player into a class, so hopefully I can work around it for the rest of my code.

1. RESPONSE
I finished most of the game other than the character models/pixels and the defeat/winning screen.
2. RESPONSE
My goal is to finish the rest of my project, so my defeat/victory screen, a restart button, and importing the character designs.
3. RESPONSE
I don't know how to import the character designs so I'll be asking for help on it.

# Friday

1. RESPONSE
I finished the rest of my project and updated my README.
2. RESPONSE
My goal is to tweak my README just a little bit before we present.
3. RESPONSE
I should've add a picture to my actual background and some music of some sort. I also never was able to properly add an image onto README.md...

1. What HTML, CSS, and or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?
2. What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?

1. Response
I've learned how to use the drawImage function for canvas as well as how to import the pictures and utilize it in drawImage. This project also provided some good practice for some topics we learned but didn't practice as much such as classes, intervals and event listeners.
2. Response
I definitely feel like I would benefit from more practice with css and displaying different elements on the screen such as objects, maps, movement, etc.

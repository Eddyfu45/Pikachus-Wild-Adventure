I made a general outline of my game with a summary of how it plays, potential changes to game depending on some technical issues, and a picture/diagram as a visual.

My goals for today is to code out the layout and some of its functions.

My main blocker would be whether or not I can google well enough to implement the harder ideas. The general basic structure consists mainly of code we learned in class so that should be fine.

I did a simple transition between the start screen and the game. Afterwards, I started fiddling around with the AI settings and player character.

I will have to transition my npc and player into a class, so hopefully I can work around it for the rest of my code.
